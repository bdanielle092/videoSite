    <p>Hi, I am a video editing and software developer. I started my career in video editing in 2006.<br> I helped with film production and editing for a school called the center for creative media.<br>I have since been doing freelance jobs. I started my
        career in software development in 2019.<br> I did self-study and then went to Nashville Software School in 2020. I have been doing freelance<br> jobs as well as my projects.<br> <br>When I am not working, my husband and I like to take our RV out
        to the lake and spend time<br>hiking. We also enjoy playing with our dogs Shelby and Rio. We also enjoy cooking and<br>spending time with our families</p>
