        <p>Hi, I am a video editor and software developer. In high school, I started to become interested in video production. I started my video production career in 2006. I help with film production and editing for a school called the center for creative
            media. I mainly worked on testimonies and promos. I continued my learning at Nashville State Community College. There I learned more about design and took additional production classes. After school, I have done freelance jobs for schools,
            churches, and businesses. In 2019 I started to explore python. I decided to go to Nashville Software School in 2020. In the first part of the school, I learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. For the second part, I learned C# and SQL. We did
            several group projects as well as personal projects. Check out my GitHub to view my projects https://github.com/bdanielle092 When I am not working, my husband and I enjoy traveling in our RV to different lakes. We love to play with our two
            dogs, Shelby and Rio. We also love to cook and spend time with family/friends.</p>
